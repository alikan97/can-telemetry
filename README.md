# can-telemetry
Research for a stm32 MCU based hardware which would report over CAN bus runtime status of internal combustion engine.

Basic idea is to have a cheap, robust and easy attachable engine monitoring device with CAN interface.
Interfacing to PC or Smartphone would be done via EM327 based USB/Bluetooth adapter.
